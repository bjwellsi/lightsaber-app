                    This guard can be entered into via a stable turn during a lower thrust guard while maintaining your saberâ€™s position in space. This is a rear weighted position.
                    <hr/>
                    This is a good position from which to perform strong thrusts, even without taking a step. It can also be used to parry with a false-edge reverse uppercut. </p>
